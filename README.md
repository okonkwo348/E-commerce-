E-commerce Django Project
Overview
This is a Django-based e-commerce RESTful API that allows users to browse products, make purchases using PayPal, and manage their accounts. The project uses Django REST Framework for API development, Djoser for JWT authentication, and PayPal for secure payment processing. It is hosted on GitHub and deployed to Render.
Features

User Management: Register, log in, and manage user profiles using JWT authentication.
Product Management: View available products with details like name and price.
Order Processing: Create orders and pay securely via PayPal.
API Documentation: Swagger and DRF docs for easy endpoint exploration.
Admin Interface: Manage products, orders, and users via Djangoâ€™s admin panel.

PayPal Integration
The orders app integrates PayPal for secure payments:

Create Payment: When a user selects a product, the CreatePaymentView generates a PayPal payment link. The user is redirected to PayPal to complete the payment.
Payment Success: After payment, PayPal redirects back to the success endpoint, where PaymentSuccessView confirms the payment and updates the order status.
Setup: Ensure PayPal credentials are set in .env. Get credentials from the PayPal Developer Dashboard.

Deployment to Render

Push your code to GitHub.
Create a Render account and a new Web Service.
Configure:
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py migrate
Start Command: gunicorn project.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
Environment Variables: Add SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL), PAYPAL_*, etc.


Deploy and test the live URL.
Set DEBUG=False and configure static files for production.

Testing

Run tests: python manage.py test
Test PayPal payments in sandbox mode using test accounts from the PayPal Developer Dashboard.
Use tools like Postman to test API endpoints.
